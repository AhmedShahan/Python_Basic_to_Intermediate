## Benifit of commenting according to Chat GPT
'''
Commenting in programming serves several important purposes, providing numerous benefits for both the developers and anyone else who may work with the code. Here are some key advantages of adding comments to your code:

Code Documentation:

Comments serve as a form of documentation, explaining the purpose, functionality, and usage of different parts of your code. This is crucial for understanding the codebase, especially when others (or even yourself at a later time) need to read and maintain the code.
Improved Readability:

Well-commented code is more readable and understandable. Clear and concise comments help developers quickly grasp the logic and intentions behind specific code segments, making it easier to follow the flow of the program.
Facilitates Collaboration:

In collaborative development environments, comments help team members understand each other's code, making it easier to work together on projects. When code is shared, commented sections provide insights into the author's thought process and intentions.
Debugging Assistance:

Comments can be helpful when debugging code. By providing explanations for complex algorithms, tricky logic, or potential issues, comments guide developers in identifying and fixing bugs more efficiently.
Prevents Misunderstandings:

Comments help to prevent misunderstandings about the purpose or behavior of a particular piece of code. They clarify the developer's intentions and reduce the likelihood of misinterpretations.
Code Maintenance:

During code maintenance or updates, comments act as a roadmap for developers, guiding them through the existing codebase. This is particularly useful when making changes to code that was written by someone else or by yourself after a long period.
Educational Value:

Comments are valuable for educational purposes. For those learning to code or for new team members, well-documented code serves as a learning resource, helping them understand programming concepts and best practices.
Compliance and Standards:

Comments can be used to indicate adherence to coding standards or compliance with specific requirements. This is important in industries or projects where coding standards must be followed for consistency and maintainability.
Automatic Documentation Generation:

Some tools can generate documentation automatically based on comments. By using a documentation generator, comments become an integral part of the project's documentation, ensuring that it stays up-to-date with the codebase.
Future Reference:

Comments provide a form of self-reference for future developers, including yourself. They offer insights into the rationale behind certain design decisions, algorithms, or implementations that might not be immediately obvious from the code alone.
In summary, commenting in programming is a valuable practice that contributes to code clarity, collaboration, maintenance, and overall software development efficiency.
